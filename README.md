# MovingShapes
First assignment from a course about creating games in C++. Idea is to read window, font and shape settings from a file and then draw shapes and their names on screen.
Shapes have a text related to them (I called it "name" but it can be any text) and centar of text should be aligned with center of shape.
Shapes and text coresponding with them should bonce of boarder of window when they hit it.
